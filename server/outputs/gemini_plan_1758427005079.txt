Actual macronutrient content may vary slightly.  It is also advisable to check the ingredients for allergens or other specific dietary requirements before consuming any item.  The  "MYO Stir Fry" and "Salad Bar" options are excluded due to their lack of nutritional data.  Some adjustments might be needed based on actual available food items and their exact nutritional information.
