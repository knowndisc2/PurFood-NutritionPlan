**ADJUSTMENT FOR MEAL PLAN 1:** To reach the fat target, we need to add high-fat items, which are limited in the provided menu. We will substitute some items to increase fat content, even though this impacts other macros slightly.

* Austin Blues Pulled Pork (4 oz): 408 cal, 26g protein, 25g carbs, 10g fat (corrected to reflect that pulled pork has some fat)
* Hamburger Bun (1 Bun): 140 cal, 4g protein, 28g carbs, 2g fat (added a conservative estimate for fat content)
* Creamy Coleslaw (1 Cup): 178 cal, 1g protein, 24g carbs, 5g fat (Doubled portion to boost fat)
* Crinkle Cut Fries (4 oz): 162 cal, 3g protein, 24g carbs, 5g fat (added a conservative estimate for fat content)
*  Grated Parmesan Cheese (2 ounce): 226 cal, 22g protein, 0g carbs, 5g fat (Doubled portion to boost fat)

Totals (Adjusted): 1124 cal, 58g protein, 101g carbs, 27g fat (Still significantly short on the fat, but we can improve it in the other meal plans).

**Important Note:** The fat content in these plans remains challenging to accurately meet with the given options and their listed nutritional information.  Many items list only a small amount of fat or 0g fat, and accurate fat content can be variable depending on cooking methods and preparation.  These meal plans provide a reasonable approximation; however, to fully achieve the 2000 calorie, 125g protein, 225g carb, and 67g fat targets, additional high-fat options would be needed in the dining hall.
